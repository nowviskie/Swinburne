          <l n="14">From your wrath is the world released, redeemed from your chains, men say. </l>
          <l n="15">New Gods are crowned in the city; their flowers have broken your rods; </l>
          <l n="16">They are merciful, clothed with pity, the young compassionate Gods. </l>
          <l n="17">But for me their new device is barren, the days are bare; </l>
          <l n="18">Things long past over suffice, and men forgotten that were. </l>
          <l n="19">Time and the Gods are at strife; ye dwell in the midst thereof, </l>
          <l n="20">Draining a little life from the barren breasts of love. </l>
          <l n="21">I say to you, cease, take rest; yea, I say to you all, be at peace, </l>
          <l n="22">Till the bitter milk of her breast and the barren bosom shall cease. </l>
          <l n="23">Wilt thou yet take all, Galilean? but these thou shalt not take, </l>
          <l n="24">The laurel, the palms and the pæan, the breasts of the nymphs in the brake; </l>
          <l n="25">Breasts more soft than a dove's, that tremble with tenderer breath; </l>
          <l n="26">And all the wings of the Loves, and all the joy before death; </l>
          <l n="27">All the feet of the hours that sound as a single lyre, </l>
          <l n="28">Dropped and deep in the flowers, with strings that flicker like fire. </l>
          <pb n="79"/>
          <l n="29">More than these wilt thou give, things fairer than all these things? </l>
          <l n="30">Nay, for a little we live, and life hath mutable wings.</l>
          <l n="31">A little while and we die; shall life not thrive as it may? </l>
          <l n="32">For no man under the sky lives twice, outliving his day. </l>
          <l n="33">And grief is a grievous thing, and a man hath enough of his tears: </l>
          <l n="34">Why should he labour, and bring fresh grief to blacken his years? </l>
          <l n="35">Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; </l>
          <l n="36">We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fulness of death. </l>
          <l n="37">Laurel is green for a season, and love is sweet for a day; </l>
          <l n="38">But love grows bitter with treason, and laurel outlives not May. </l>
          <l n="39">Sleep, shall we sleep after all? for the world is not sweet in the end; </l>
          <l n="40">For the old faiths loosen and fall, the new years ruin and rend. </l>
          <l n="41">Fate is a sea without shore, and the soul is a rock that abides; </l>
          <l n="42">But her ears are vexed with the roar and her face with the foam of the tides. </l>
          <l n="43">O lips that the live blood faints in, the leavings of racks and rods! </l>
          <l n="44">O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods! </l>
          <pb n="80"/>
          <l n="45">Though all men abase them before you in spirit, and all knees bend, </l>

          <l n="47">All delicate days and pleasant, all spirits and sorrows are cast </l>
          <l n="48">Far out with the foam of the present that sweeps to the surf of the past:</l>

          <l n="50">Waste water washes, and tall ships founder, and deep death waits: </l>
          <l n="51">Where, mighty with deepening sides, clad about with the seas as with wings, </l>
          <l n="52">And impelled of invisible tides, and fulfilled of unspeakable things, </l>
          <l n="53">White-eyed and poisonous-finned, shark-toothed and serpentine-curled, </l>
          <l n="54">Rolls, under the whitening wind of the future, the wave of the world. </l>
          <l n="55">The depths stand naked in sunder behind it, the storms flee away; </l>
          <l n="56">In the hollow before it the thunder is taken and snared as a prey; </l>
          <l n="57">In its sides is the north-wind bound; and its salt is of all men's tears; </l>
          <l n="58">With light of ruin, and sound of changes, and pulse of years: </l>
          <pb n="81"/>
          <l n="59">With travail of day after day, and with trouble of hour upon hour; </l>
          <l n="60">And bitter as blood is the spray; and the crests are as fangs that devour: </l>
          <l n="61">And its vapour and storm of its steam as the sighing of spirits to be; </l>
          <l n="62">And its noise as the noise in a dream; and its depth as the roots of the sea: </l>
          <l n="63">And the height of its heads as the height of the utmost stars of the air: </l>
          <l n="64">And the ends of the earth at the might thereof tremble, and time is made bare. </l>
          <l n="65">Will ye bridle the deep sea with reins, will ye chasten the high sea with
            rods?</l>
          <l n="66">Will ye take her to chain her with chains, who is older than all ye Gods? </l>
          <l n="67">All ye as a wind shall go by, as a fire shall ye pass and be past; </l>
          <l n="68">Ye are Gods, and behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at last. </l>
          <l n="69">In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of things, </l>
          <l n="70">Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for kings. </l>
          <l n="71">Though the feet of thine high priests tread where thy lords and our forefathers
            trod, </l>
          <l n="72">Though these that were Gods are dead, and thou being dead art a God, </l>

          <l n="73">Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head, </l>

          <l n="75">Of the maiden thy mother men sing as a goddess with grace clad around; </l>
          <l n="76">Thou art throned where another was king; where another was queen she is crowned. </l>
          <l n="77">Yea, once we had sight of another: but now she is queen, say these. </l>
          <l n="78">Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas, </l>

          <l n="80">And fleeter than kindled fire, and a goddess, and mother of Rome. </l>
          <l n="81">For thine came pale and a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours, </l>

          <l n="85">For thine came weeping, a slave among slaves, and rejected; but she </l>
          <l n="86">Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on the sea. </l>
          <l n="87">And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds and the viewless ways, </l>

          <l n="88">And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays. </l>

          <l n="90">Ye were all so fair that are broken; and one more fair than ye all. </l>
          <l n="91">But I turn to her still, having seen she shall surely abide in the end; </l>

          <l n="103">Thou art more than the Gods who number the days of our temporal breath; </l>
          <l n="104">For these give labour and slumber; but thou, Proserpina, death. </l>
          <l n="105">Therefore now at thy feet I abide for a season in silence. I know </l>

          <l n="77">Tender of speech, and had no hardihood </l>

          <l n="81">That read beside her stricken with a rod, </l>
          <l n="82">She would cry sore and say some word to God </l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l n="86" rend="ti-1">In middle Rome there was in stone-working </l>

          <l n="95">That shed sweet yellow through the thick wet red, </l>
          <l n="96">That on high days was borne upon the head </l>
          <l n="97">Of Venus' priest for any man to drink; </l>

          <l n="103">That in the fighting Trojan time was bled; </l>

        <lg>
          <l n="113" rend="ti-1">It was their worship, that in August days </l>

          <l n="122" rend="ti-1">This knight went out and prayed a little while, </l>

          <l n="133">So thou wilt be my lady without sin. </l>
          <l n="134">Goddess that art all gold outside and in, </l>
          <l n="135">Help me to serve thee in thy holy way. </l>
          <l n="136">Thou knowest, Love, that in my bearing day </l>
          <l n="137">There shone a laughter in the singing stars </l>
          <l n="138">Round the gold-ceilèd bride-bed wherein Mars </l>
          <l n="139">Touched thee and had thee in your kissing wise. </l>
          <l n="140">Now therefore, sweet, kiss thou my maiden's eyes </l>
          <l n="141">That they may open graciously towards me; </l>
          <l n="142">And this new fashion of thy shrine shall be </l>
          <l n="143">As soft with gold as thine own happy head.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l n="144" rend="ti-1">The goddess, that was painted with face red </l>
          <l n="145">Between two long green tumbled sides of sea, </l>
          <l n="146">Stooped her neck sideways, and spake pleasantly: </l>
          <l n="147">Thou shalt have grace as thou art thrall of mine. </l>
          <l n="148">And with this came a savour of shed wine </l>
          <l n="149">And plucked-out petals from a rose's head: </l>
          <l n="150">And softly with slow laughs of lip she said, </l>

        <lg>
          <l n="152" rend="ti-1">Then came Theophilus to Dorothy, </l>
          <l n="153">Saying: O sweet, if one should strive or speak </l>
          <l n="154">Against God's ways, he gets a beaten cheek </l>
          <l n="155">For all his wage and shame above all men. </l>
          <l n="156">Therefore I have no will to turn again </l>
          <l n="157">When God saith ``go,'' lest a worse thing fall out. </l>
          <l n="158">Then she, misdoubting lest he went about</l>
          <l n="159">To catch her wits, made answer somewhat thus: </l>
          <l n="160">I have no will, my lord Theophilus, </l>
          <pb n="280"/>
          <l n="161">To speak against this worthy word of yours; </l>
          <l n="162">Knowing how God's will in all speech endures, </l>
          <l n="163">That save by grace there may no thing be said. </l>
          <l n="164">Then Theophile waxed light from foot to head, </l>

          <l n="166">It is well seen you are a chosen thing </l>
          <l n="167">To do God service in his gracious way. </l>
          <l n="168">I will that you make haste and holiday </l>

          <l n="170">Covered none else, but crowned upon your hair, </l>
          <l n="171">And do the service that a maiden doth. </l>
          <l n="172">She said: but I that am Christ's maid were loth </l>
          <l n="173">To do this thing that hath such bitter name. </l>
          <l n="174">Thereat his brows were beaten with sore shame </l>
          <l n="175">And he came off and said no other word. </l>
          <l n="176">Then his eyes chanced upon his banner-bird, </l>
          <l n="177">And he fell fingering at the staff of it </l>
          <l n="178">And laughed for wrath and stared between his feet, </l>
          <l n="179">And out of a chafed heart he spake as thus: </l>
          <l n="180">Lo how she japes at me Theophilus, </l>
          <l n="181">Feigning herself a fool and hard to love; </l>
          <l n="182">Yet in good time for all she boasteth of </l>
          <l n="183">She shall be like a little beaten bird. </l>
          <l n="184">And while his mouth was open in that word </l>
          <l n="185">He came upon the house Janiculum, </l>
          <l n="186">Where some went busily, and other some </l>
          <l n="187">Talked in the gate called the gate glorious. </l>
          <l n="188">The emperor, which was one Gabalus, </l>
          <pb n="281"/>
          <l n="189">Sat over all and drank chill wine alone. </l>
          <l n="190">To whom is come Theophilus anon, </l>
          <l n="191">And said as thus: <hi rend="i">Beau sire, Dieu vous aide</hi>. </l>
          <l n="192">And afterward sat under him, and said</l>
          <l n="193">All this thing through as ye have wholly heard.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l n="194" rend="ti-1">This Gabalus laughed thickly in his beard. </l>
          <l n="195">Yea, this is righteousness and maiden rule. </l>
          <l n="196">Truly, he said, a maid is but a fool. </l>
          <l n="197">And japed at them as one full villainous, </l>
          <l n="198">In a lewd wise, this heathen Gabalus, </l>
          <l n="199">And sent his men to bind her as he bade. </l>
          <l n="200">Thus have they taken Dorothy the maid, </l>
          <l n="201">And haled her forth as men hale pick-purses: </l>
          <l n="202">A little need God knows they had of this, </l>
          <l n="203">To hale her by her maiden gentle hair. </l>
          <l n="204">Thus went she lowly, making a soft prayer, </l>
          <l n="205">As one who stays the sweet wine in his mouth, </l>
          <l n="206">Murmuring with eased lips, and is most loth </l>

          <l n="221">Who laughed in all his throat some breathing-whiles: </l>
          <l n="222">By God, he said, if one should leap two miles, </l>
          <l n="223">He were not pained about the sides so much. </l>
          <l n="224">This were a soft thing for a man to touch.</l>
          <l n="225">Shall one so chafe that hath such little bones? </l>
          <l n="226">And shook his throat with thick and chuckled moans </l>

          <l n="283">For one to sit and hearken to such saws: </l>
          <l n="284">I were as lief fall in some big beast's jaws </l>
          <l n="285">As hear these women's jaw-teeth chattering; </l>
          <l n="286">By God a woman is the harder thing, </l>
          <l n="287">One may not put a hook into her mouth. </l>
          <l n="288">Now by St. Luke I am so sore adrouth </l>
          <l n="289">For all these saws I must needs drink again. </l>
          <l n="290">But I pray God deliver all us men </l>
          <l n="291">From all such noise of women and their heat. </l>
          <l n="292">That is a noble scripture, well I weet,</l>
          <l n="293">That likens women to an empty can; </l>
          <l n="294">When God said that he was a full wise man. </l>

          <l n="310">Certes, he said, by Gabalus my name, </l>

          <l n="316">Yea, maid I am, she said, and somewhat sighed, </l>
          <l n="317">As one who thought upon the low fair house </l>
          <l n="318">Where she sat working, with soft bended brows </l>
          <l n="319">Watching her threads, among the school-maidens. </l>
          <l n="320">And she thought well now God had brought her thence </l>
          <l n="321">She should not come to sew her gold again.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l n="322" rend="ti-1">Then cried King Gabalus upon his men </l>

          <l n="325">And bends his body sidelong in his bed, </l>
          <l n="326">So wagged he with his body and knave's head,</l>
          <l n="327">Gaping at her, and blowing with his breath. </l>

          <l n="329">Out of his lewdness with his cursèd wives: </l>
          <l n="330">His bones were hewn asunder as with knives </l>
          <l n="331">For his misliving, certes it is said. </l>
          <l n="332">But all the evil wrought upon this maid, </l>
          <l n="333">It were full hard for one to handle it. </l>
          <l n="334">For her soft blood was shed upon her feet, </l>
          <l n="335">And all her body's colour bruised and faint. </l>
          <l n="336">But she, as one abiding God's great saint, </l>

          <l n="338">Wherefore the king commanded afterward </l>
          <l n="339">To slay her presently in all men's sight. </l>
          <l n="340">And it was now an hour upon the night </l>
          <l n="341">And winter-time, and a few stars began. </l>
          <l n="342">The weather was yet feeble and all wan </l>
          <l n="343">For beating of a weighty wind and snow. </l>

          <l n="350">And in the middle of this wayfaring </l>
          <l n="351">Full tenderly beholding her he said:</l>

          <l n="354">But always with lean cheeks and lifted feet </l>
          <l n="355">These dead men lie all aching to the blood </l>

          <l n="359">To give his life and get such bitterness? </l>
          <l n="360">Also the soul going forth bodiless</l>
